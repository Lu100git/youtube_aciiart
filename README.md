# youtube_aciiart
this is the code i used for creating the profile pic and background acii art on Linux,
it's a very simple program by using the concept of gotoxy

i used cat command from linux in order to skyp some steps on the printing of chracters,

if you want to use it on windows, just replace the cat system command and paste the ascii profile pic art,

and you don't need to loop, it, i did it for other porpuse outsde of the video
